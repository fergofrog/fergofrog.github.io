This is a follow up to the previous post on [compling XNU 4570.41.2 for ARM64](2018-07-07-compile-xnu-for-arm64.md), but covering the newly released XNU 4903.221.2 (macOS 14.1).
This guide is, again, mostly based on [the kernelshamin guide](https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2018/12/building-xnu-for-macos-mojave-10141.html).

The future of compilation for arm64 looked bad from Apple's release of xnu-4570.71.2 which contained several broken components for the architecture.
Thankfully, this release required only two minor modifications (and nothing to code!):
  1. We don't have access to the device map database, nor the `embedded_device_map` tool, thankfully these are only needed to actually build for the device
  2. As before, `Availability.h` is needed but not included in the `installhdrs` stage - simply fixed by modifying `EXTERNAL_HEADERS/Makefile`

This release included Apple's intended use for the `MACHINE_CONFIG` build variable. This allows the targetted AP to be specified as part of the build (or 
for multiple device builds to occur). In the original modifications, I hardcoded the T8011 board, but later included a great suggestion from @zhouwei
([see issue #1](https://github.com/fergofrog/xnu/issues/1)) which did exactly what Apple has now released. An additional machine is also included, the BCM2837,
the AP for the Raspberry Pi 3 - very cool! The big challenges that someone would need to resolve for the rpi3 is that a device map is needed, ideally they would
create an `embedded_device_map` tool, and a custom iBoot to take over from the Pi's bootloader and pass off to XNU. @zhouwei has done this for [qemu](https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu/)
and of course [Corellium](https://corellium.com/) have done it better than anyone - it can be done!

# tl;dr
The complication process is as simple as following the [kernelshaman blog](https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2018/12/building-xnu-for-macos-mojave-10141.html),
with the following modifications:
  1. Use my repository for [xnu 4903.221.2](https://github.com/fergofrog/xnu/tree/xnu-4903.221.2) - it contains modifications to the xnu source 
     necessary for building 
     * _Note_: if you would rather build from Apple's source, check the [diff](https://github.com/fergofrog/xnu/commit/70b35d4532423155f62cdafe0d4e12bfb90836ad)
       from my repo for changes I made
  2. a copy of the `TargetConditionals.h` header must be made from the iPhoneOS SDK's `/usr/include` directory to the 
     iPhoneOS SDK's `/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers` directory in order to build
     libfirehose
  3. When building: the SDK is "`iphoneos`", the ARCH is "`arm64`", and XNU's build also needs `ARCH_STRING_FOR_CURRENT_MACHINE_CONFIG=arm64`

# The Details
This process was tested on a mostly-clean macOS 10.14.2 with Xcode 10.1.

## CTF Tools
The CTF tools (`ctfconvert`, `ctfdump` and `ctfmerge`) are executed as part of XNU's build and are expected to be in 
your hosts's SDK path.

For macOS 10.14.1 dtrace has had a version bump to 262.50.12. Compilation requires some additional header search paths
to resolve locating `elf.h` and a few others.

```bash
tar zxvf dtrace-262.50.12.tar.gz
cd dtrace-262.50.12
mkdir obj sym dst
xcodebuild install -sdk macosx \
    -target ctfconvert -target ctfdump -target ctfmerge \
    ARCHS=x86_64 SRCROOT=$PWD OBJROOT=$PWD/obj \
    SYMROOT=$PWD/sym DSTROOT=$PWD/dst \
    HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS="$PWD/compat/opensolaris/** $PWD/lib/**"
sudo ditto \
    $PWD/dst/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain \
    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain
cd ..
```

## AvailabilityVersions
AvailabilityVersions provides a perl script used as part of the XNU build. Build and installation is per the blog, 
except the install target is the `iphoneos` SDK.

AvailabilityVersions had a version bump to 33.200.4 in macOS 10.14.1, however the installation is as before.

```bash
tar zxvf AvailabilityVersions-33.200.4.tar.gz
cd AvailabilityVersions-33.200.4
mkdir dst
make install SRCROOT=$PWD DSTROOT=$PWD/dst
sudo ditto \
    $PWD/dst/usr/local/libexec \
    $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/usr/local/libexec
cd ..
```

## libplatform Headers
Just three header files are required from this project. These are now at version 177.200.16, but install is the same.

```bash
tar zxvf libplatform-177.200.16.tar.gz
cd libplatform-177.200.16
sudo mkdir -p \
    $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/usr/local/include/os/internal
sudo ditto $PWD/private/os/internal \
    $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/usr/local/include/os/internal
cd ..
```

## XNU Headers
The headers are ready to be built now. I'd recommend using my repo and check the [diff](https://github.com/fergofrog/xnu/commit/70b35d4532423155f62cdafe0d4e12bfb90836ad)
to see what I did.

After the headers are installed, a copy of the `TargetConditionals.h` header must be made from the SDK's `/usr/include`
directory to the SDK's `/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers` directory in order to build
libfirehose.

```bash
git clone -b xnu-4903.221.2 https://github.com/fergofrog/xnu.git
cd xnu
make LOGCOLORS=y SDKROOT=iphoneos ARCH_CONFIGS=ARM64 MACHINE_CONFIGS=T8011 \
     KERNEL_CONFIGS=RELEASE ARCH_STRING_FOR_CURRENT_MACHINE_CONFIG=arm64 \
     installhdrs
sudo ditto $PWD/BUILD/dst $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)
sudo cp $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/usr/include/TargetConditionals.h \
    $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers/TargetConditionals.h
cd ..
```

## libfirehose_kernel From libdispatch
The kernel libfirehose header and objects are required to build XNU. As before, the XNU headers and `TargetConditionals.h` need to be in place, however the new
libdispatch 1008.220.2 requires several additional modifications, documented by the [kernelsharman blog](https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2018/12/building-xnu-for-macos-mojave-10141.html).

```bash
tar zxvf libdispatch-1008.220.2.tar.gz
cd libdispatch-1008.220.2
mkdir obj sym dst
awk '/include "<DEVELOPER/ {next;} /SDKROOT =/ {print "SDKROOT = macosx"; next;} {print $0}' \
    xcodeconfig/libdispatch.xcconfig > .__tmp__ && \
    mv -f .__tmp__ xcodeconfig/libdispatch.xcconfig
awk '/#include / { next; } { print $0 }' \xcodeconfig/libfirehose_kernel.xcconfig > .__tmp__ && \
    mv -f .__tmp__ xcodeconfig/libfirehose_kernel.xcconfig
xcodebuild install -sdk iphoneos -target libfirehose_kernel \
    SRCROOT=$PWD OBJROOT=$PWD/obj SYMROOT=$PWD/sym DSTROOT=$PWD/dst \
    ENABLE_BITCODE=no
sudo ditto $PWD/dst/usr/local \
    $(xcrun -sdk iphoneos -show-sdk-path)/usr/local
cd ..
```

## XNU
Now it's time to build XNU. With all the setup from before, this process is as simple as one command.

```bash
cd xnu
make LOGCOLORS=y SDKROOT=iphoneos ARCH_CONFIGS=ARM64 MACHINE_CONFIGS=T8011 \
     KERNEL_CONFIGS=RELEASE ARCH_STRING_FOR_CURRENT_MACHINE_CONFIG=arm64
```
